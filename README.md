## Background
I found the benchmarks included in the zip files for discussion 2 to have typos which I wanted to change.

Also my classmate Daniel Mirsky wrote excellent scripts for automating compiling and running the benchmarks. 

I wanted to combiine these two things with a nice README to reduce future students errors in running these benchmarks so the focus can be comparing the results instead of troubleshooting a system.
